Good [food|positive|Good]!
This is a great [place|positive|great] to get a delicious [meal|positive|delicious].
The [staff|positive|friendly] is pretty friendly.
The [onion rings|positive|great] are great!
The [lemon chicken|negative|sticky sweet donuts] tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the [honey walnut prawns|negative|not good], the few they actually give you.....were not good.
Nice [ambience|positive|Nice, overrated], but highly overrated [place|negative|overrated, overrated].
Worst [Service|negative|Worst] I Ever Had
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst [service|negative|worst] we had ever received.
Our [waiter|negative|non-existent] was non-existent and after our [food|negative|over an hour after we ordered] finally arrived over an hour after we ordered, we were not given any water or utensils.
I complained to the [manager|negative|not even apologetic], but he was not even apologetic.
Fabulous [Italian Food|positive|Fabulous]!

The [food|positive|great] was great!
– In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants, its nice to see a place that bucks that trend, and just plain delivers high quality [food|positive|high quality] and good [service|positive|good], period.
This is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality [food|positive|best quality] the industry can offer.
Caution - its real [food|positive|real] for people who love the best.
I liked the [atmosphere|positive|liked] very much but the [food|negative|not worth the price] was not worth the price.
I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the [food|negative|okay] here is just okay and that there is not much else to it.
[Rice|negative|dry] is too dry, [tuna|negative|wasn't so fresh] wasn't so fresh either.
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the [fish|positive|excellent] to be excellent.
However, the value and [service|negative|lacking] are both severely lacking.
Furthermore, while the [fish|positive|fresh] is unquestionably fresh, [rolls|negative|bland] tend to be inexplicably bland.
The [service|negative|mediocre, offensive] ranges from mediocre to offensive.
On a recent trip, our [waiter|negative|dissive] was extremely dismissive, while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.
Freshest [sushi|positive|Freshest] – I love this restaurant.
They pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex [rolls|positive|complex].
The [sashimi|positive|freshest, tender] was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted.
Their [apps|positive|delicious] are all delicious.
The only drawback is that this [place|negative|expensive] is really expensive and the [portions|negative|small] are on the small side.
But the [space|positive|small, lovely] is small and lovely, and the [service|positive|helpful] is helpful.
– The [food|negative|not great] was not great & the [waiters|negative|rude] were rude.
great [service|positive|great]
my [service|positive|stark] was stellar!
[food|positive|fine] was fine, with a some little-tastier-than-normal [salad|positive|tastier-than-normal].
the [food|positive|great] was great, the [margaritas|positive|great] too but the [waitress|negative|too busy] was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me.
Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great [pizza place|positive|great].
Best [Sushi|positive|Best] in town.

The [sushi|positive|delicious] here is delicious!
They have a wide variety of [fish|positive|wide variety] and they even list which oceans they come from ; Atlantic or Pacific.
I've had the [Jellyfish|positive|good], [Horse Mackerel|positive|good], [Blue Fin Tuna|positive|good] and the [Sake Ikura roll|positive|good] among others, and they were all good.
The [decor|positive|rustic, traditional Japanese] is rustic, traditional Japanese.
The [service|positive|honest, attentive] was courteous and attentive.
Mediocre [food|negative|Medocre]
The [outdoor patio area|positive|abbreviated] has an abbreviated menu.
My g/f and I both agreed the [food|negative|mediocre] was very mediocre especially considering the price.
We are locals, and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average [food|negative|average] is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.
[Service|positive|decent] was decent.
[Drinks|positive|good] were good.
Excellent [food|positive|Excellent], nice [ambience|positive|nice], fairly expensive (expensive)
– I loved the [pumpkin ravioli|positive|loved] and the [goat cheese gnocchi|positive|loved] ( 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis ) and my sister loved her [filet mignon|positive|loved] on top of spinach and mashed potatoes.

It's located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center, not the greatest [location|negative|not the greatest], but the [food|positive|keeps me coming back for more] keeps me coming back for more.
Never too crowded and always great [service|positive|great].
I can highly recommend their various [saag|positive|recommend] and [paneer|positive|recommend] and [korma|positive|recommend].
I appreciate their [delivery|positive|appreciate] too.

[Dinners|positive|excellent] have always been excellent, in terms of food quality.
The [side of potatoes|positive|die for] is to die for, as is the [labne ( yogurt dip )|positive|die for].
Also, they serve THE best [hummus|positive|best] in America, with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil ( which, I believe is the traditional way )!
The only drawback is the crowded [seating|negative|crowded] and the slow [service|negative|slow].
However, this [place|positive|gem] is a gem, and I won't stop going back.
great [beer|positive|great]
I swore never to return for a warm [beer|negative|warm] and mediocre [meal|negative|mediocre].
The [band|positive|good] was very good and the [service|positive|attentive] was attentive.

The [atmosphere|positive|ok] was just okay.

Not only can the [selection|positive|innovative] be innovative, but there's a nice [balance of traditional sushi|positive|nice] as well.
The nicest [waiters|positive|nice] in town.
– This [place|negative|over-rated] is unbelievably over-rated.
If I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average brunch food, then I would put [Murphy's|positive|top] at the top of the list.
The [regular menu|negative|above average] here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive.
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut [fish|positive|expertly cut], great [sake|positive|great], a killer [SOHO|positive|killer], and of course : Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel

Great value [sushi|positive|Great value] with high quality & nice [setting|positive|high quality, nice].
Try the Chef's Choice for sushi as the [smoked yellowtail|positive|incredible] was incredible and the [rolls|positive|tasty] were also tasty.
Poor [customer service|negative|Poor] / poor [pizza|negative|poor].
– As with most restaurants in Seattle, [Mioposto's] was bad and the [food|negative|overpriced] was overpriced.
I know many people have their favorite types of [pizza|negative|favorite] and [pizza places|negative|favorite], but Mioposto's pizza lacks quality and good taste.
To be honest, I've had better [frozen pizza|positive|better].
The only positive thing about [Mioposto|positive|positive|positive|positive|positive|positive|positive|positive|positive|positive|positive|positive|positive] is the nice [location|positive|nice].
I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews - this [place|positive|fantastic] is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way, and we've eaten here more than 10 times.
The [food|positive|fantastic] is fantastic, and the [waiting staff|positive|perfect] has been perfect every single time we've been there.

Great [Pizza|negative|Great], Poor [Service|negative|Poor]
– Love their [pizza|positive|Love], especially the [mushroom pizza|positive|Love].
Also love their [caveser salad|positive|love].
Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I don't like the [servers|negative|like], one young woman in particular.
Many people talk about the great [pizza|negative|great] and poor [service|negative|poor], so it can't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers.
It's a great little [place|positive|great little] with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the [service|positive|impersonal, corporate-like] weren't so impersonal and corporate-like.
Great [Breakfast|positive|Great]
The [food|positive|great] is great and they make a mean bloody mary.
I love [breakfast|positive|love] here.
Their [crab eggs benedict|positive|depressing] is addicting.
All their [menu items|positive|hit] are a hit, and they serve [mimosas|positive|serve].

the [ambiance|positive|nice, good] of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning.
the [staff|positive|nice, courteous, chinese] was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese.
so about the [prawns|positive|fresh, crisp], they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the [bath batter|positive|good, crunchy, tasty]... soooo good... the [wainsnuts|positive|crunchy, crunchy, tasty] were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.
best [honey walnyt prawns|positive|best] that we have every tasted.
the [brocollis|positive|fresh, tasty] were so fresh and tasty.
i would normally not finish the [brocolli|positive|eventful] when i order these kinds of food but for the first time, every piece was as eventful as the first one... the [scallops|positive|fresh, nicely cooked] and [prawns|positive|fresh, nicely cooked] was so fresh and nicely cooked.
Chintzy [portions|negative|Chintzy]
– The [sushi|positive|good] here is perfectly good, but for $ 5 a piece, either the [slices of fish|positive|large] should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant ( even for NYC ).
Terrible [service|negative|Terrible], [food|negative|ok] ok, pricey
[Food|negative|ok, pricey] wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the [restaurant|negative|fancy] isn't a fancy place.
Another plus is the open feel of the [restaurant|positive|open] with glass walls on all sides.
Amazing [Spanish Mackeral special appetizer|positive|Amazing] and perfect [box sushi|positive|perfect] ( that eel with avodcao -- um um um um um ).
As usual the [omikase|positive|freshness] didn't disappoint in freshness, although it scored low on creativity and selection.
Their [specialty rolls|positive|impressive] are impressive, though I can't remember what we had.
Great [sake selection|positive|Great].
It isn't the cheapest [sushi|positive|cheapest] but has been worth it every time.
Very poor [customer service|negative|poor].
– Schooner or Later's charming [location|negative|charming] along the marina in Long Beach and average [food|negative|average] does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor [customer service|negative|poor].
While this diner had reasonably good [food|negative|good], the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of [service|negative|lack of].
the [fish|positive|fresh] was fresh, though it was cut very thin.
great [service|positive|great].
good [sake selection|positive|good].
– [Ray's|positive|high quality] is THE place to go for high quality [seafood dinners|positive|high quality].
I love [Dungeness crabs|positive|love] and at Ray's you can get them served in about 6 different ways!
We shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the [black cod in sake kasu|positive|enjoyed].
I ended the meal with the unusual [dessert|positive|unusual] of a port and chocolate tasting... yummy!
And the [service|positive|spendid, delight] was simply spendid - quite a delight.
Great [Breakfast|positive|Great]

Best Neighborhood [Standby|positive|Best].
In Grammercy/Union Square/East Village this is my neighbors and my favorite [spot|positive|favorite].
The [music|positive|great] is great, no night better or worse, the [bar tenders|positive|generous] are generous with the pouring, and the lighthearted [atmosphere|positive|lighthearted] will lifts you spirits.
Oh, and the [cheese fries|positive|awesome] are awesome!
Good [Food|positive|Good], Great [Service|positive|Great], Average Prices ( For the Strip )
When I walked in, I was taken aback by their incredible [wood decor|positive|incredible].
The [music|positive|hip] playing was very hip, 20-30 something pop music, but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat, which became annoying midway through dinner.
I got the [shellfish and shrimp appetizer|positive|alright] and it was alright.
It wasn't the freshest [seafood|negative|freshest] ever, but the taste and presentation was OK.
I picked the [asparagus|positive|incredible, perfectly prepared], which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared.
The [steak|positive|exact liking] was done to my exact liking ( medium rare ) and was nice and juicy.
It? s served with either a [pizza sauce|negative|indistinguishable] or [red wine reduction|negative|indistinguishable], though both were indistinguishable in taste.
The [desert|positive|perfect] was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.
But the [servers|positive|attentive, friendly] were extremely attentive and very friendly.
good [sake|positive|good], good [food|positive|good] – i honestly don't know much about japanese food at all.
Server made several [sake suggestions|positive|good] which were very good.
had many dishes but the BEST was the [lobster 3 ways|positive|BEAUTIFUL].
The [waiter|negative|unfriendly] was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded.
Most importantly, we were so excited about the [food|positive|excited] after seeing the very creative [menu|positive|creative].
At best, the [food|negative|good, overpriced] was good and definately overpriced.
My favortie [pizza joint|positive|favorite] in Seattle

You won ’ t be disappointed by their [menu|positive|disappointed].

Nothing on the [menu|positive|amazing] is less than amazing.
Good [eats|positive|Good].
I have been to this [place|negative|BAD], folks and it is BAD.
Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use [fish|positive|decent] that's half-way decent.
I have been here, spent tons of money on a [chef special dinner|negative|dissappointment] and it was a major dissappointment.

It's a tiny [place|negative|tiny] so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend ( Thurs? Sun ) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the [sushi bar|positive|easy].
Everything, and I mean everything on the [menu|positive|delectable] is delectable.
The [waiters|positive|experienced, helpful] are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa.
The [sushi|positive|fresh] is as fresh as it comes? you 'd think ocean was in their backyard, no joke!

Groovy [music|positive|groovy] made the [dinner|positive|casual] casual.
I have a but here - there was a [bathroom attendant|negative|odd] in the restroom which was odd.
The [bathroom|negative|small] itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.

The [atmosphere|positive|aspiring] is aspiring, and the [decor|positive|decor|positive|decor] is festive and amazing...

[Drinks|positive|suberb] are suberb, and I feel like I am in a Third World country when I walk in the door.
- Mediocre [Service|neutral|Mediocre] / Quality
The [presentation of Snooze|positive|excellent] is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced [IHOP|negative|overpriced] with a high brow [menu|negative|high brow].
They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small [juice|negative|small] at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their [menu|positive|unique] was so unique that I continued.
The [pastas|negative|inventive] were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 '' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 '' ) in the [pasta flight|negative|over-priced] ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over-priced.
The [pancakes|positive|larger] should be larger ( at least 8 '' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings.
In the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small [pancakes|positive|small], a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea ( I had water ).
Much more than just a great [view|positive|great]!
– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at [Ray's Boathouse|positive|exceeded my expectations] last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.
[Ray's|positive|seattle institution] is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous [Sound views|positive|gorgeous], I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the [food|negative|due to] and [service|negative|due].
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the [views|positive|third-best] are only the third-best thing about Ray's!
To start things off, our lovely [server|positive|beautiful] Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order.
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the [Shilshole Sampler|positive|ambitious]... a beautiful assortment of enormous [white gulf prawns|positive|beautiful], smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic [manila clams|positive|fantastic] seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty [soy dressing|positive|tastlesome beurre sauce
For my entr & eacute ; e, I completely enjoyed the [seared Alaskan sea scallops|positive|enjoyed] complemented by [chard|positive|enjoyed], [artichoke hearts|positive|enjoyed], [fennel|positive|enjoyed], and [pecorino toscano|positive|enjoyed].
The [scallops|positive|unique, tasty] are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ).
My friend enjoyed the [grilled Alaskan King Salmon|positive|enjoyed] with delectable [creamed Washington russet potatoes|positive|delectable] and crisp [green beans|positive|enjoyed].
I had a taste of all three items on her plate, and they were superb.
Our [server|positive|attentive] continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue : Who thinks that [Ray's|negative|muddled] is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful [server|positive|wonderful] and [food|positive|wonderful] made the experience a very positive one.
Oh yeah... the [view|positive|good] was good, too.
